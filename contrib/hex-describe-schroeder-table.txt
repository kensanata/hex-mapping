;procedures
1,<strong>Procedures</strong>: <em>random encounters</em> are 1 in 6 per day and 1 in 6 per night if you’re not behind walls. If you’re <em>looking for something</em> that isn’t as obvious as a town or village built in plain sight, your chance of finding it is also just 1 in 6 per day; underground encounters are 1 in 6 every two turns, e.g. whenever leaving a room.

;spells
1,<strong>Scrolls, prayers and spells</strong>: a <em>scroll</em> can only be read by magic users and elves that know the spell or have access to <em>read magic</em>; a <em>prayer</em> can be read by anyone. The spells used are from the <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/pdfs/spellcasters/">Spellcasters</a> project.

;treasure
1,<strong>Treasure</strong>: the value of a <em>gem</em> is determined by rolling a d20 and looking it up on the <a href="#gems">table</a>; the value of <em>jewelry</em> is determined by rolling 3d6×100gp.

# Trap room features. General format: hint; hint; hint → effect;
# effect (no trailing punctuation; the intended use is as a list item.

;concealed trap
1,**net**: tripwires trigger a net falling from the ceiling → save vs. rays or be caught for 1d6 rounds; wood blocks attached along the edges cause a ruckus and attracts wandering monsters
1,**trap door**: hollow sound if tapped → triggered on 1 in 6 per person: 10ft deep pit, take 1d6 damage
1,**tripwire poison arrow**: triggered by a pole; wall is nicked where arrows missed their target; single hole on the opposing side; visible wire when moving with a light source → roll an attack against the first person: 1d6 damage and save vs. poison or die

;trap
3,[concealed trap]
1,**checkerboard floor**: traces of dirt on the safe tiles; save vs. breath or take 2d6 damage unless you move like a [chess piece]
1,**chest**: [chest], sweet smell if examined closely → booby-trapped with sleep gas, all must save vs. poison or lose consciousness for 20min
1,**darts**: walls nicked and holes on the opposing side; raised floor segment indicates pressure plate → roll attacks against the first person: 1d4/1d4/1d4 damage
1,**deep pit**: a deep pit with a visibly crumbling edge supported by rotting wooden beams → anybody approaching the pit has a 2 in 6 chance of triggering a collapse and falls 30ft for 3d6 damage
1,**falling rocks**: rickety construction with frail, rotten support beams → anything but careful sneaking triggers a ceiling collapse: all must save vs. death or die
# Buffalo Castle 24A!
1,**fog chest**: [chest], traces of a metallic green condensate all over it; transformation magic detectable; a tiny plaque reads (roll 1d4): 1. “🜁:🜚→🝗” (gold to ashes), 2. “🜁:🜛→🝗” (silver to ashes), 3. “🜁:🜠→🝗” (copper to ashes), 4. “🜁:🜜→🝗” (iron to ashes) → opening the chest releases the fog which will transform any exposed metal of the indicated type to dust: armour, unsheathed weapons, rings, diadems, or bracelets worn, etc
1,**oil**: a small coal fire up above is heating a cauldron suspended on a metal rod just below the ceiling; a pressure plate turns the cauldron over → dousing everybody in boiling oil for 1d8 damage; a 2 in 6 chance for the fire falling into the oil and igniting it, causing another 1d8/rd for the next two rounds
1,**pendulum blade**: a vertical slit on both sides and on the ceiling; a pressure plate → roll an attack against the first person: 1d8 damage; anybody has a 4 in 6 chance of evading the pendulum’s attack
1,**rope trap**: straw covers the floor; sweeping the straw reveals the rope; a curtain hides a large stone on a rope above a small well → stepping on the trigger releases the stone, pulling the rope, ripping the victim off its feet and leaves it dangling above the well; loud crash of the stone attracts wandering monsters
1,**scorched pedestal with statue of [power] holding a [gem]**: fire magic detectable; statue’s hand with the gem is connected to the arm with a hinge → movement of the hand unleashes a *fireball*, 5d6 damage to all in the room, save vs. explosions for half
1,**skunk chest**: [chest], musty smell if examined closely → booby-trapped with skunk oil spray; all present are odoriferous for the next 3 days, i.e. fail all Charisma checks, random encounters underground are doubled: roll 2d6 instead of 1d6
1,**smoke trap**: obscures visibility while attackers enter from another room
1,**spiked ball**: save vs breath or 2d6 dmg
1,**stagnant pool**: boat on the far side
# from Holmes’ sample dungeon!
1,**statue pointing**: points at door just entered; must be rotated on base to point to another door; any door it is pointed at can’t be opened
1,**statue of [power] with diadem**: the diadem holds a [gem] → the diadem is tied to the statue’s head with a very thin wire → pulling the wire releases corrosive gas, save vs. poison or suffer 3d6 damage
1,**trapped floor**: triggered on 1 in 6 per PC to fall in pit with a **giant spider** ([giant spider stats])
#H/T Buffalo Castle!
1,**treasure mirage**: a hoard of gold pieces that has alerted the nearest monsters to come and attack, at which point the gold pieces will disappear
1,**underground stream**: leads to rapids out of the dungeon, 3d6 damage
1,**walls closing in**: once every player has wedged a weapon between the wall and floor, the wall stops closing in, but the weapons are ruined, otherwise roll d20 under your dexterity or be crushed
1,**wide pit**: roll d20 under your dexterity to jump across or fall 30 feet (3d6 damage)

1,[capitalize metal mat] doors conceal niches filled with the picked-clean bones of ancient [human|elf|dwarf] lords.
1,Stacked meticulously along the walls in a morbidly beautiful arrangement are thousands of bones and hundreds of skulls.
1,Several small pits, each containing an urn and ashes make traversing this room hazardous.

;debris room desc
#shoutout to Colossal Cave!
1,You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface. Perhaps testament to a long-ago flood.

;firewood room desc
1,A stack of freshly cut firewood sits here, from which the aroma of pine and [tree] emanates.

1,A carefully stacked woodpile completely obscures a wall in this room.

;great hall desc
1,Long stone tables line this room, but all that remains of the chairs and benches is some rotted wood piled in the corner, smelling like termites and swamp.

1,Glowering from above a blocked up fireplace is the giant taxidermied head of a [boar|deer|lion|bear|owlbear|manticore|gorgon|wyvern], in a deplorable state.
1,Covered in cobwebs and egg-sacs, faded tapestries along the walls hint at this rooms former glory.

;guano pit desc
1,The stench of this room hits you before you can see it properly: a pit filled with guano, above which sleep hundreds of small [black|brown|vampire] bats.
1,A rotting wooden bridge, recently swept clean but with occasional spots of guano, leads over a pit full of the stuff. The smell is worse than any [latrine|privvy]. Anyone who rolls above their dexterity score breaks a board and drops into guano, taking 1d6 damage.
1,The clamor of high-pitched chirps and squeals echoes from the darkness above, the stench of ammonia hangs heavy in the air above a floor covered in guano.
1,An overturned wheelbarrow and some broken shovels rest near a large pile of astringent bat droppings.

1,Three cradles stand silently here, among broken kindling that might once have been childrens’ toys. Even the mice have abandoned the swaddling.

1,A vaulted ceiling overlooks an iron wall of metal doors, all but one open and revealing empty cubicles.
1,A giant locked [iron|metal] safe squats in the middle of the room, its huge iron door attesting to dozens of attempts to break in - it has been beaten, burnt, and subject to toxic magic. But the door is still shut.
1,Wooden shelves from many cabinets and bookcases have been toppled and are rotted, the empty lairs of vanished termites. Stone vaults, their great doorways broken and scattered, sit empty.

1,The air is damp and brackish; an iron grate over a pit covers a water source.
1,A small trickle of water splashes quietly into a stone basin here from a bas-relief of a [cherub|satyr|angel|demon|[devil]]. The water seems fresh and pure.

;necropolis description
1,Huge, grey stones have been connected by smooth grey walls, blocking off the valley. There is a grey tower and a massive gate in the wall.<p>[necropolis gate]<p>[grey tower]
1,A ten-foot-tall black iron fence blocks the way here. Some of the spikes at the top of the fence are adorned with skulls of humans and other humanoids.<p>[necropolis gate]<p>[grey tower]

;necropolis gate
1,The *gate* is large enough to admit a giant, made of wood and iron and decorated in bronze, held together by spells. The doors show a crowd of demonic faces, teeth, horns, claws, and bulging eyes.
1,The *gate* is a blackness of cold and despair. Anybody close to the gate feels their life drain away and as their body ages. Touch the gates drains and eventually kills you.
1,The *gate* is still humming with magical energies. Shimmering lines show penitentiaries humbly begging for entrance. If you knock on the gates with nothing but your clothes on, empty handed, no weapons, no armour, no metal, then it will slowly open for you and just for you. If anybody else tries to slip through, the doors will slam shut: save vs. death or be crushed.

;grey tower
1,[grey tower description]<p>[grey tower inside]<p>[grey tower top]

;grey tower description
# usage: The first tower is [grey tower description]
1,Towering above the walls is a bulging *tower* with vertical slits serving as windows, like the visor of a fancy helmet.
1,Rising above the wall is a massive *tower* that suffered mightily under some heavy blows. It still stands but it is smashed open, the insides laid bare for all to see.
1,To the right of the gate stands a massive *tower* that had its top blown off. Over the years, this has allowed plants to gain a foothold. Bushes and grass grow from the top like green hair from a huge stone face.
1,Behind the wall there is a thin *spire*, impossibly high, with barely enough space for a staircase, or maybe ladders. It looks more like a mast with a crow’s nest at the top.

;grey tower inside
1,The wall and the tower are decorated with colourful banners but it’s hard to discern anything intelligible. Apparently anything that flutters in the wind gets used up here. [goblins]
1,The bellowing of horny hill giants can be heard far and wide. The walls and the tower are their love nest. [hill giants]
1,There are plenty of thick, wooden poles rising from the wall and sticking in the flanks of the tower. If the sun is up, you an see a crow-headed warriors jumping and shadow fighting up there: [1d12 tengu] Master *[same tengu name]* can [teach a fighter]
1,A bunch of ragged tents between wall and tower are the broken dreams of some desperate people. [bandits]
1,There is an improvised toll booth next to the tower and some tents further back. These people ask 50gp per head “to keep the area safe.” [bandits]
1,This is the realm of [stone giants] They are methodically moving cut stones the size of cattle, rebuilding the tower. They place a block, then move back and contemplate it's position for an hour, then repeat.

1,The top of the tower is inaccessible from the interior. A circus of [2d8] young **griffons** ([griffon stats]) is roosting up there when they’re not trying to impress each other with fantastic displays of aerial stunts. [maybe griffon eggs]
1,A stair leads up to the top of the tower but nobody ever takes it for up there the air is unnaturally cold and half-transparent **spectre** is staring at the necropolis below. “Everyone I know has gone away, in the end.” All they are interested in is talking about the great armies they took to the [with direction] and to the [and direction], how they fought the armies of *[a wight capital]*, the manoeuvres they executed, the traps they set, the princes they had assassinated. This is *[a strange royal]*. Turning the conversation away from their achievements makes them very irate ([spectre stats]; *summon 1d4 servants* with the same stats). [ancient treasure]
1,At the top of the tower, through a painted arch and out onto a platform there is a throne, and on it sits the **spectre** *[a strange royal]*, desiccated and old, bones held together by leather straps and nails. They’re looking at the necropolis below. “This is my empire of dirt. You can have it all!” They butchered all their enemies. They rose in the ranks of *[an old wight leader]*. They held offices in *[a wight capital]*. Talking about the presence angers them ([spectre stats]; *summon 1d4 servants* with the same stats). [ancient treasure]

1,The necropolis itself consists of dozens of mausoleums, each built according to the same plan: a fake entrance leading an altar where descendants left flowers and food for the dead, with paintings of their exploits and achievements, and a *hidden* entrance from above, sealed with a heavy drop stone, trapped by spiked pits below and crushing stones above, filled with poison dust or a brazier of *warp* blood resulting in terrible mutations. And finally, [1d8 mummies] patiently waiting for news from the world of the living ([mummy stats]). They want to know about the world outside but they are unwilling to part with any treasure they might have.
1,The necropolis itself is an endless graveyard, tombstone after tombstone, filling every slope in this valley, stone statues, inscriptions, pictures, headstones engraved with [Set decoration] or [Pazuzu decoration]. At night the ghosts rise from their graves, lamenting the state of their graves and the lack of care, the sloth of their descendants, and they curse them and their world, not realising that their world has already faded and that they are the only ones left. Appropriate rites and sacrifices, a purification and a hallowing might bring them peace.
1,This might have been a necropolis hundreds of years ago but now it’s more like a meadow. There are still some overgrown headstones to see, some mausoleums are still standing, some statues can be discerned, but most of it is pasture now, [mountain animals] grazing and a bunch of orcs working on their [mountain orc product]. The banners on their tents intents identify them as [evil tribe] orcs. [orcs] [mountain orc leader specialty]
1,The valley is filled with ruins. This must have been a large monastic complex in its heyday. These days the ceilings have fallen, walls have crumbled, weeds are growing everywhere and anything not made of stone has rotten away. It’s hard to say what these buildings were used for. Here you can see an engravings of [Pazuzu decoration], over there is an engraving of [Set decoration].
1,The necropolis turned to dust over the years and now nothing but a few statues and crumbled mausoleums remain. Amidst this decay stand newer huts made of wood and dried mud, covered in grass and decorated with banners of [with colour] and [and colour]. [6d6] **lizard people** ([lizard people stats]) live up here, led by *[lizard leader]* (HD [1d4+2 as level]). [leader treasure] The huts are guarded by [lizard companions]. [average treasure] At night they gather around a central fire and sing songs of old, of love, of longing and of leaving, of great deeds and the old days.

;necropolis sphinx
1,In the middle of all this is a platform that rises 20ft into the air. Wide stairs lead up to a baldachin and under this canopy rests the [sphinx]
1,In the middle of all this is a column an perched on it, 60ft above the surrounding land rests the [sphinx]
1,In the middle of all this is a platform made of stone, circular and about five feet high. On it a wooden structure rises up into the air and at the very top rests the [sphinx]

;naga fortress
1,At the end of this valley the mountains rise up like a wall and on that wall is a giant *seven-headed snake* made of living stone, as if melted and reshaped by the strongest spells. In each of the seven heads there burns a magic fire. This is *[here snake place]*.<p>Down below, at the foot of the wall, there is [snake gate]
1,On the pass at the end of this valley there is a structure: *seven towers* growing out of the same rock, bending upwards into the sky, each ending in a snake head, maw wide open, each containing a hall with a brazier in which an eternal flame is burning. This is *[here snake place]*.<p>Down below, where the seven snake necks meet the steep trail leading up to the pass there is [snake gate]
1,Rectangular blocks of stone have been carefully stacked here forming *rounded domes* of various shapes and sizes. The domes are all clustered together giving the appearance they grew from this valley like anthills. This is *[here snake place]*.<p>One of the smaller domes has a pathway leading to it, flanked by [snake gate]
1,Near the top of this mountain, an eroded slope turns into a valley containing a clear lake in the center. On the shore of the lake, a worn *stone pyramid* echoes the shapes of the mountains. This is *[here snake place]*.<p>On the south-facing side, there is [snake gate]

;snake gate
1,a *gate of snakes*: a knot of two impossibly large stone snakes with a passage underneath illuminated by torches and guarded by [snake people]
1,a *maw of thorns*: a tunnel with a thousand inwards pointing needles several feet long and but a thin path winding its way through it. In front of the maw is a platform, facing south. It is much warmer here than one would expect this far up. [lizard people]
1,a *walkway* lined on either side by carved stone pillars, each shaped to give the appearance of an enormous snake wrapped around it, there opened mouths threatening those who pass. If you misstep, the snakes' mouths shoot **poison darts** at the unwary: save vs. poison or die.

;temple of Set
1,Once past the entrance, a tunnel winds itself up into the hollow sphere of the snake sanctum: the upper hemisphere is decorated with [with Set decoration] and [and Set decoration]. Above hangs a chandelier about 50ft wide beset with a thousand stones glowing in a warm light. It’s impossibly hot in here.<p>Ramps connect rows and rows of circular platforms leading down the lower hemisphere to the bottom of the sphere. One these platforms are the huts of [temple servants]<p>At the very bottom of the sphere is a ramp descending into the darkness below.
1,Inside, the central temple contains four bronze snake statues oriented towards the cardinal directions. Large red candles at the base of each statute give a flickering and smoky light. Each statute has a different colored gem set in its forehead (500gp each). The north wall contains a giant mural of [with Set decoration] and the floor is decorated with a mosaic of [and Set decoration].<p> Under the mural, a passage leads further north, past the quarters of [temple servants]<p>At the end of the hallway, stairs lead upwards.
1,The air inside the temple is surprisingly warm and damp. Lush green plants scramble over stairs and wrap around pools of steaming water. Hidden in the greenery, humans with patches of iridescent scales on their skin observe and wait, for now. [snake people]

#starting point for food and drink tables for menus/food items
#basic construction: tables for domestic/garden and wild food products
#sub-tables for specific types of veg/seasoning herbs/descriptions and preparation methods
#meat: I try to use the "food names" for animals here if they exist, hence the "meat quantifier" in the table names
#also doing cheese with some cheese producing animals and a few descriptors focusing on texture/type/flavor
#breads exists now, probably needs more options
#plurals are pretty common for things that are consumed in groups, there are a few singulars, but I don’t think they will create too much trouble.
#also imported berries (I prefer the prefix method for this), updated fruits
#still to do potentially: climate/terrain variations and adherence. These may require revising the tables, for now I’m just going to assume a handy trade network for produce/meat :)
#some recipes may not seem too appetizing thanks to the random generation, but there’s no accounting for local tastes :)

1,Steep tunnels twist themselves into the bowels of the earth. There are sharp edges everywhere, but at least you can walk.
1,The tunnel passes through cavern after cavern on the way down. The tunnel walls are smooth and warm to the touch.
1,The passages leading down are small cracks and shafts, barely enough to squeeze through. The rocks are warm and the air is dry and hot.
1,Sulphur vapours make it hard to see far. Yellow mud cakes the walls and hot steam is bubbling in tiny cracks wherever you go.
1,Impossible as it seems, this passage seems to be dug into charred wood, as if bored by huge beetles into Yggdrasil itself.

;road to Muspelheim obstacle

1,The air grows hotter, a red glow fills the tunnel, and finally it opens into a cavern filled with a lava lake inhabited by [2d4] **salamanders** led by *[salamander name]* ([salamander stats]). [terror treasure]
1,The tunnel opens up into a cavern 100ft across and at the far end, the exit is guarded by a **pyrohydra** ([pyrohydra stats]).

[5d8] **dwarves** live and work here ([dwarf stats]) led by [dwarf with portrait] (level [1d6+2 as level]). [luxurious context] [dwarven treasure] From the lower gate, the tunnel continues towards Muspelheim.
1,The tunnel opens up into a huge vertical shaft, disappearing into darkness above and ending in a bubbling lava lake at the bottom. Narrow stairs lead down to the lake. This is the home of the **red dragon** *[here red dragon name as dragon name]*[dragon portrait] ([red dragon stats])[store dragon as treasure type] A path continues along the lava lake and leads to the next tunnel entrance.

;exit to Muspelheim
1,Eventually, you feel a light draught and then at last, there’s light: the tunnel opens up into a steep valley dug by a lava river. The sky above you is black but there are lava falls on all sides, pouring into the river. A trail turns [left|right] and leads you up to a giant building on a cliff overlooking the valley of fire.<p>[store lava as liquid][fire giant building]
0,The tunnel ends at a huge iron gate. There’s a [hammer on a chain|a big ring] fastened to the gate, a kind of knocker. Using it will summon the **ifrit** called *Furnace of a Thousand Hell Hounds* ([ifrit stats]).

If killed, the elf will soon reincarnate as another lion and return.
1,<p>The bodies of [1d4+1] adventurers are decomposing on the stairs leading up the next level. They seem to have died a painful death and yet they have no obvious injuries. They did not know about the **poison gas trap** triggered by the third step. If triggered, save vs. poison or die.

1,<p>Furter up, where heaven and earth appear to meet, the Earth Blood has turned previous visitors into [2d6] [slimes].
1,<p>Further up and behind locked and iron-bound doors is a large room with a [1d4+1] gorgeous old wooden tables and many chairs decorated with fern leaves and roses.

1,The temple looks like it is but a heap of dead bodies made of stone. Everywhere are hands, feet, faces, bones.

;fire giant temple of Hel
1,The entrance to the temple is shrouded in magical darkness. Inside the blackness is the guardian of this temple, a **three-headed giant hell-hound** named *[cerberus name]* ([cerberus stats]).
1,The path leading up to the temple passes beneath two rows of giant [fire material] ribs rising 50ft into the air.

;fire giant temple of Mitra

1,The inside of the temple is dizzying array of platforms connected by short stairs, with [fire material] trees burning under a roof 60ft above. Along the walls are rows of statues. If you know the history of dwarves and giants, you’ll recognise the statues of [fire giant statues].
1,The inside of this temple might at one time have been glorious but now it is filled with boiling grey mud and dancing shadows. The fires burning along the walls show fallen statues and broken columns disappearing the blubbering mass. The stink of sulphur hangs in the air.

;fire giant courtyard
1,The stones and walls of this courtyard are glowing red. Anything touching them will start to burn if combustible.
1,The walls surrounding the courtyard are decorated with long black iron spikes, needles as long as a man or two, pointing up, in order to discourage flying opponents from landing.
1,The courtyard itself encloses a lava-filled pit crossed by a bridge made of [fire material].

;fire giant reception
1,At the foot of the fortress are some workshops. This is where blackened  [3d8] **dwarves** ([dwarf stats]) slave at the anvils and bellows led by [dwarf with portrait] (level [1d4+2 as level]). They are chained to their workstations, their bedrolls right next to their tools. The food and water they require is stored inside the fortress, behind locked doors in [fire material] coffers.
1,At the foot of the fortress is a hot pool of [same liquid] where orange worm people can be seen: [2d4] **salamanders** led by *[salamander name]* ([salamander stats]) live here.

;fire giant top floor
1,The top of the fortress is a big room with a throne surrounded by many giant statues. These are the personifications of *[with fire person]* and *[and fire person]*. [1d4 fire giants]
1,The fortress looks like a [fire material] pitchfork. Each of the three needles is a sequence of ladders and small rooms, spiral stairs, with narrow windows and tiny balconies. Dozens of iron grates, scythe blades and spiked pits make progress painfully slow. [1d4 fire giants]
1,The fortress looks like a [fire material] candelabrum with [three|four|five] branches, each ending in a large study, surrounded by a round platform, overlooking the cavern. Each platform has stacks of heavy stone disks, the kind the giants know how to throw for devastating effect. [1d4 fire giants]
1,Up above, the conical tower of [fire material] is covered in long spikes and thorns, each of them as long as a man or longer. This is a formidable defence against the landing of dragons and other air borne enemies. Narrow widows allow the inhabitants to control the surrounding land without exposing themselves. [1d4 fire giants]
1,The fortress grows out of a rocky outcrop like a scrawny tree, with lava tunnels leading up to the [fire material] tower like intestines twisting this way and that way, leading into larger rooms full of strange machinery, perfect for an ambush by the [5d8] **duergar** in the service of these giants ([duergar stats]). The tower itself is small in comparison. [1d4 fire giants]

# These are the monsters for larger villages
;trees
1,This is the [forest name]. [signs of human activity]<p>[a monster threatening the village]

;signs of human activity
1,Tall trees cover this valley. Occasionally, you can see tree stumps so somebody must be logging these trees.
1,There are many trails made by loggers, wood gatherers and swine herders leading to a village.
1,The trees along the trails through this forest have all been coppiced, i.e. cut down near the ground level in order to produce wood.
1,The lack of branches and trees lying on the forest floor is a sign of regular wood gatherers.
1,Within the forest are a few clearings with small cherry and plum tree orchards.
1,Within the forest are a few clearings with small apple tree orchards.
1,There is a clearing in this forest where [an old statue] of *[power]* still stands.

;a monster threatening the village
1,You shouldn’t stray too far from the trails because this forest has been cursed by the presence of [2d4] **harpies** ([harpy stats]) luring men into the depths of the forest and to their death with their magical singing. [terror treasure]
1,Deep in the forest there is a cave where the **ettin** *[ettin]* lives ([ettin stats]). It is known for its fury and its appetite for human flesh. Luckily, it fears [horses|archers|armoured fighters|groups of more than a handful of people] and the locals have adapted. [robber treasure]
1,Hiding between the trees are the watchful eyes of [1d12 bugbears] ([bugbear stats]). [scout treasure] Bugbears are usually a bad sign for they are often employed as spies by the elves of the netherworld. These carry amulets of passage bearing the [name for a clan of the netherworld elves] sigil.
1,The camp of [1d12 bugbears] is hard to find ([bugbear stats]). [scout treasure] They hunt these woods at night and like to kill anybody that didn’t make it back to the village during daytime.
1,[orcs] They keep a low profile, living deep in the forest, but lone travellers, or fools that don’t make it back to the village before sunset, or reckless idiots looking for trouble, they’ll all find the orcs to be more than willing to kill.

;dryad lover
2,At the foot of the tree lies a human skeleton. She is looking for a new lover!
1,She’s crying because her lover [man] (a level [1d6+1 as level] [human class]) just left her. “Bring him back,” she implores you!
1,She’s coy and flirtatious because she knows full well that her lover [man as human name] (a level [1d6+1 as level] [human class]) is bound to show up any minute now. Oh how she loves to see those peacocks fight! [spellbook for [same class]] [leader treasure for [same class]]
1,She’s sad and melancholy for it seems that both her lovers have learned of each other. There’s the [lover type] *[man as human name]* (a level [1d6+1 as level] [human class]), and she loves him dearly. [spellbook for [same class]] [leader treasure for [same class]] But there’s also the [lover type] *[man as human name]* (a level [1d6+1 as level] [human class]), and she loves him just as much! [spellbook for [same class]] [leader treasure for [same class]]
1,She sends her lover [man as human name] (a level [1d6+1 as level] [human class]) to deal with you. [spellbook for [same class]] [leader treasure for [same class]]

;ettercap ground level
1,Spider webs between the trees make progress impossible. Desiccated deer and birds hang in these nets. Touching these nets or setting them on fire attracts [2d4] **giant spiders** ([giant spider stats]).
1,Between the gnarled roots of giant [tree] trees you see the opening of burrows large enough to be bear dens (at least [2d4] of them). If anybody passes within 20ft of such a hole, a **giant tarantula** ([giant spider stats]; *surprise* on 1–5 in 6) jumps out of the burrow and attacks. When the fighting begins, the remaining spiders are attracted by the stomping.
1,The ground rises and forms a little mound here, promising a look at the surrounding land. But actually, a group of [2d4] **giant trapdoor spiders** ([giant spider stats]) have dug tunnels and pits around here. Anybody climbing the mound has a 1-2 in 6 chance of sliding and falling into a 20ft pit (2d6) and being beset by these spiders.

;ettercap lake
1,The trees of [forest name] open up and there’s a small island up ahead, covered in giant trees shrouded in spiderwebs. There are dessicated birds and bats and bigger things (wyverns, young dragons, griffons?) caught in the web up there. If you’re patient, you can see movement beneath the water as giant spiders dart out of their silken diving bells to kill fish. [2d4] **giant diving bell spiders** ([giant spider stats]; *swim*) live in this lake. It is not safe for swimming.
1,The trees of [forest name] open up and there’s a small island up ahead. Big silken strands connect the giant trees growing on that island with the trees growing along the lake’s edge. From it, smaller strands hang down, filling the air and sinking into the water. During the day, you can see [2d4] **giant spiders** working these strange fishing lines ([giant spider stats]).
1,The trees of [forest name] open up and there’s a small island up ahead. Giant trees grow on that island. A sweet, musky flagrance of wisteria and roses fills the air. On these trees [2d4] **giant bolas spiders** hunt for prey ([giant spider stats]; *bola*: 30ft ranged attacks with a weighted *capture blob* of sticky silk on a line).

;ettercap lair
1,Up in the trees are some tree houses connected by several ropes. If you’re not afraid of heights, you can easily walk from one to the other, feet on one rope and hands holding another one. The tree houses are home to [2d4] **ettercaps** led by [ettercap with portrait] ([ettercap stats]). [average treasure] [ettercap prisoners]
1,Up ahead is a rocky outcrop, about 100ft high, wrapped in spider webs. In the cracks of this rock live [2d4] **ettercaps** led by [ettercap with portrait] ([ettercap stats]). [average treasure] [ettercap prisoners]

;elf environment
1,The settlement is nearly impossible to spot from the ground level.
1,At night, the settlement is illuminated by magic light.
1,During the day, sweet music can be heard from the tree tops.
1,Dangling upside-down from the larger branches of the [tree] trees is a small colony of [1d6+1] **giant bats** ([giant bat stats]). They are easily disturbed and once awake their cries surely alert the elves.
1,The settlement thrives in symbiosis with a hive of [1d6+1] **giant bees** ([giant beetle stats]).
1,Patrolling the leaf litter, is a small pack of [1d2+1] **blink dogs** guarding the elves to repay an ancient debt ([wolf stats]; *intelligent*; *blinking*: can only be hit on an *even* roll of the d20).
1,As agile and silent in the branches as they are on the forest floor, the settlements perimeters are patrolled by [1d2+1] **giant ocelots** ([jaguar stats]).
1,Installed strategically throughout the settlement are [1d2+1], mostly stationary **wood golem archers** ([wood golem stats]). Each can instantaneously sprout new arrows from their ligneous bodies.
# for reference see here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/waldopepper/46335454624/
1,Sentinels in the skies above and surprisingly agile fliers, [1d2+1] **griffons** ([griffon stats]) are fully capable of narrow dives through the leafy canopy and navigating the branches and boughs of the [tree] trees.
1,A parliament of [1d4+1] **giant owls** ([owl stats]) nests nearby and will defend their elven friends to the death.
# 1,A single, small **roc** can sometimes be seen scouting above.
# giant eagles/birds of prey seem to fit with elves, but larger versions of smaller birds (like Butcher Birds, Kingfishers, and Jays could be neat)
1,Gifted with effective camouflage that conceals as they cling to the larger [tree] trunks, [1d4+1] **giant geckos** watch for any trespassers ([giant lizard stats]).
1,Typically found lounging on larger [tree] branches and blending in with the massive vines are [1d6+1] **giant pythons**, trained to immobilise any interlopers ([giant snake stats]). They only kill their victims if others continue attacking them.
1,A bloom of [3d6] **sprites** are never far from this settlement and can often serve as an early warning system by delaying any intruders with their pranks and mischief ([sprite stats]).
1,Ancient guardians from a forgotten time, [1d2+1] **crystal living statues** stand silent guard over the settlement ([stone golem stats]).
1,The very trees themselves often leap to the settlement’s defense thanks to the efforts of [1d2+1] befriendet **treants** ([treant stats]).
1,The settlement has cultivated deliberate gardens of **shrieking fungus** whose piercing cries are quick to alert them of any invaders.
1,Throughout the leaf litter are innocuous looking **puffball mushrooms** that, if inadvertently pierced or damaged emit clouds of slumber spores.
1,The elves have chosen this site well, for [1d3+1] of their tree-homes are inhabited by **dryads** whose beguiling magics often transforms potential foe to fast friend ([dryad stats]).
1,Scores of innocuous **song birds** are quick to betray the presence of any infiltrators with their loud, screeching warning songs.
1,The air is filled the sweet, intoxicating fragrance of *honeysuckle* vines that weave throughout the branches and bushes.
1,It’s easy to feel watched in this part of the wood, as every [tree] tree trunk features a stern looking **face**.
1,There are quite a few skeletons lying under the trees. The reason being the lush brambles here concealing blood-sucking **vampiric vines**: If you make camp, save vs. spells or die overnight as they immobilise you and suck you dry.
1,Touching any tree here without whispering the secret elven words of soothing is not advised, as one could be stuck fast by the quick flowing, impossibly **sticky sap**.

# requires [a war party] and a [captain]
1,[here store captain *[same captain]* was last seen in *[same village name]* carrying the banner of *[the war party]* as war fact]

;the presence of mercenaries is a problem
1,For now, *[same captain]* has forced the mercenaries to pay for all the food but the locals feel like they’re forced to sell their winter stores and once the mercenaries are gone and winter comes, what then?
1,The town is in uproar. Young *[human name]* has been found dead. They want to see the soldier hanged. Clearly, *[same captain]* is weak and discipline is slipping: it’s only a matter of time until the mercenaries take matters into their own hands.
1,The town is in uproar. Young *[human name]* has been assaulted and they want to see the soldier hanged. A delegation is speaking to *[same captain]* right now.
1,The town appears very quiet. People are keeping to their homes, afraid of what the mercenaries might do. *[same captain]* needs supplies, however, and if they’re not selling eventually they will have to take them.
1,Already the mercenaries are drinking far too much. The locals grind their teeth and clench their fists when they hear the insults and sneers of the drunken mercenaries but they know all too well that now is not the time to fight back.
1,*[same captain]* is recruiting, promising a gold piece per day while on campaign, and a share of the loot! The young and gullible are already falling for it. You can see the beardless faces of *[human name]*, *[human name]*, and *[human name]* amongst the tents. And you can see some elderly people crying outside the captain’s tent. “[We beg you|Please|Have mercy]! We need the [young ones|youngsters|children] to work the fields! Don’t take them off to war!”
1,*[same captain]* had trouble filling the ranks and so now they’re terrorising the locals, forcing them to give up their young ones: they offer to pay their parents’ debts, they’re claiming that they lost a gamble about it last night, they’re threatening to burn down their farm if they don’t come. These are the sullen faces of *[human name]*, *[human name]*, and *[human name]* in the camp.

;the presence of refugees is a problem
# no captain!
1,As the wounded start dying, the stench is spreading. Flies are everywhere. Soon, cholera and typhus will be showing up. The locals want the refugees gone, but who is going to argue with armed men? Better to stab them during the night, some might say.
1,The locals are no longer willing to support the refugees, calling them maggots and worms and worse. Nobody is willing to kill, however, and so the situation just lingers, the refugees too weak to kill the locals and simply take what they need and the locals to afraid to do away with the extra mouths.
1,The young **[human class]** *[human with portrait]* is a devout servant of [good power]. They are trying to find a solution to the problem. Surely some land could be cleared for these poor souls? Let them settle.
1,The young **[human class]** *[human with portrait]* is a devout servant of [evil power]. They have shrewdly insinuated that the locals are simply waiting for them to weaken even further until one night they’ll all just stab them. So why not take things into your own hands and act first? Strike now and take what you need!

;the presence of corpses is a problem
# no captain!
1,The many corpses have attracted the **necromancer** [human with portrait][here store [same human name] as alchemist patron] (level [1d3+4 as level]). This does not sit well with the locals.

It is guarded by [necromancer companions].
1,The many corpses are poisoning the air. The stink is horrendous. Flies are everywhere. The water is foul. *Ghoul fever* is spreading: *[human name]* and their family have turned into [1d4+2] **ghouls** roaming the graveyard at night, looking for some sweet, sweet human flesh.
1,The many corpses are poisoning the air. The stink is horrendous. Flies are everywhere. Some people say that the corpses move at night and indeed, *[human name]* has risen as a **wight** ([wight stats]). If the mess isn’t cleaned up there will be more, soon.

1,A prized **[circus exotic animal]** ([[same circus exotic animal] stats]) has escaped from their cage. [secret circus leader] is desperate and will pay 200gp to retrieve them, alive and intact.
1,Local children from *[nearby village name]* have gone missing, and many of them ran away to join *[same circus name]*. The villagers may not have much in the way of payment, but returning them would make you local heroes, and always welcome.
1,*[human with portrait]*, one of the [circus performers] that travels with the *[same circus name]* is secretely a **vampire** ([vampire stats]), with a coffin of dark earth hidden away in one of the [conveyances]. They use the nomadic nature of the [same circus2] to drain victims dry and moving on before suspicion falls on the circus.
1,The circus has been experiencing mysterious accidents lately. Just yesterday, *[human with portrait]*, one of the [circus performers], was severely injured during their act. The other performers suspect foul play, but are too busy rehearsing to properly investigate. [circus plot]
1,On their last visit to *[nearby village name]*, the circus managed to bilk the community out of most of their wealth. [1d4x10] villagers armed with pitchforks and torches led by *[human with portrait]* has been tracking them down to forcibly request refunds.
1,Times have been tough for *[same circus name]* lately, and the last performance resulted in their payment being in the form of [with trade goods] and [and trade goods], *[human with portrait]* is looking to unload them for coin.
1,The [with circus performers] have gone on strike for better wages and more safety measures. The protest has begun to escalate, roping in the [and circus performers] and [and circus performers]. The days of ringmaster *[human with portrait]* may be numbered as [secret circus leader] and her supporters *[with human name]* and *[and human name]* are outmanoeuvring them.
1,The [secret circus leader] is looking to retire and settle down in *[nearby village name]*. They’ve saved up quite a bit of coin over the years, but ringmaster *[human with portrait]* is worried that they may end up taking the [with circus performers] *[with human name]* and *[and human name]* and [and circus performers] *[and human name]* and *[and human name]* with them.
1,A horrible accident occurred during the last [sideshow attractions] performance, and [secret circus leader] will pay 50gp for a new, exciting act for tonight’s show, and another 50gp for the same show in *[nearby village name]*.
1,The mascot of *[same circus name]*, the [domestic animal adjective] **[circus exotic animal]** has died. The [secret circus leader] suspects foul play and is quick to blame the [circus performers] *[with human name]* and *[and human name]* who have been getting significantly less ring-time lately.

;circus plot
1,Indeed, the [circus performers] *[with human name]* and *[and human name]* are actually **doppelgängers** ([doppelgänger stats]). They studiously avoid any contact with alcohol in order to avoid discovery.
1,Sadly, when they fired one of the [circus performers] back in *[nearby village name]*, *[human name]* swore bloody vengeance and started following the circus, sneaking through the camp at night and sabotaging the equipment.
1,It turns out that this all started after the breakup between the [circus performers] *[with human name as a]* and *[and human name as b]* back in [nearby village name]. *[same b]* has been acting strangely ever since, losing their temper easily and secretly threatening *[same a]* with more accidents unless they come back. *[same a]* isn’t confiding in anybody because they think *[same b]* can still be saved. But how?

1,Heavy rains have caused the banks of [name for river] to swell dramatically. The high-water line is up to the waist of an Ogre on the sides of buildings, and villagers are still shoveling mud out of their homes.
1,A flash flood caught the community by surprise recently. Several buildings were ripped from their foundations and deposited a good distance away. Several are still missing, including *[same human name]*.
1,The [food veg] crop that locals depend on for their livelihood is rotting in the fields. The ground is over saturated from recent rains, and the farmers curse the grey clouds.
1,Standing water still shimmers in large pools in the low areas throughout the village. It's grown brackish and is filled to the brim with mosquito larvae. Soon the dreaded *[diseases]*, carried on buzzing wings, will be a grave concern.

#possibly merge a fetch quest here for cures from the Herb/Plant tables or get Nergal followers involved :)
;plague
1,The doors and windows of a group of homes are boarded up and painted with superstitious symbols and charms. Anyone will tell visitors that a recent outbreak of *[diseases]* is to blame. Highly contagious, quarantine is the only cure the village folk know.
1,The **healer** [human with portrait] is at their wits end. They've never seen *[diseases]* spread so swiftly. Worry turns to terror when they also begin displaying symptoms.
1,Having lost a quarter of their number to *[diseases]* the villagers are growing more desperate and paranoid. Most carry fragrant pouches of dried *[magic plant]* that they constantly sniff and a few have even fled to the surrounding wilderness out of fear of infection.
1,Long ditches are being dug by weeping townsfolk, while all spare lumber is being gathered for a massive pyre. The numerous corpses of victims of *[diseases]* must be dealt with quickly, before it spreads further.

;famine
1,The soil here has been devastated by over-farming. The [with food veg], [and food veg], and [and food veg] that the settlement depends on are no longer growing, and there will be lean times ahead.
1,The village stores are down to their last bushel of rotting [food veg]. They began rationing long ago, and already have long since slain any [livestock]. Anyone can see the hollow, gnawing pain of hunger in every set of eyes.
1,Children rush toward any visitors with hands outstretched, most are too weak to mutter anything but “food… !” For the third year in a row, blight struck the [food veg] crop, and everyone has grown desperate as bellies growl and grumble.
1,The curse of vindictive *[nearby druid]* causes seeds to no longer sprout in the soil and fruit rots before it fully ripens. Driven to desperation and delirium by hunger, the locals like to pretend that their boiled boot leather is actually a local delicacy: “[dish]!”

;drought
1,Hearts leap at the sight of any clouds, but no rain is forthcoming. For almost the entire season it's been dry, and the [food veg] are turning brown in the fields.
1,The lack of rain wouldn't be so bad, had the well not gone dry. The brittle, brown grasses aren't good for grazing, and ribs are beginning to show on the [livestock].
1,Parched, cracked earth in the furrowed fields may yield easily to the plow, but the first rains of the season are late by months. The farmers have begun to worry that it will soon be too late to plant the [with food veg] and [and food veg].
1,Even the eldest member of the community, *Old [old name]* can't remember a time when water was so scarce. The [two or three] abnormally dry seasons in a row have everyone on edge, and the locals are contemplating making a deal with *[nearby witch]* to call forth the rains again with her magic.

;locusts
1,It was only a few days ago that the sky darkened completely as millions upon millions of **[titlecase green synonym] locusts** descended on the crops. Not a single row of [with food veg] or [and food veg] remained intact from their voracious appetite.
1,What first started as just a few stray and inoffensive **[titlecase yellow synonym] grasshoppers** in the beaks of hungry chickens soon became a plague. If one listens closely, one can even hear the hordes chewing. They've completely decimated the [with food veg] and [and food veg], and will soon move on to the [and food veg]. The farmers are at their wits end.
1,When *Old Lady [strange name for women]* was [witch execution] last week, the locals thought their troubles were over. Few paid any mind to the curses she spat out shortly before she died. Now impossible swarms of **[titlecase red synonym] locusts** seem to scream her name as they ravenously devour every leaf, stalk, and bud in the farmer's fields.
1,Far less numerous than their normal-sized counterparts, but just as devastating, a plague of **[1d12+1] dire locusts** [dire locust stats] have been spotted in the [food veg] fields and have even managed to devour a few [livestock]. The desperate settlement will pay 50gp for each one slain.

1,[animal event]
1,[holiday event]

;harvest event
1,Judging is underway for a prize-winning [with food veg] contest, including some of the largest [and food veg] you've ever seen: fit for a giant's table.
1,Inexplicably clement weather has led to a bumper crop of [with food veg], the villagers are practically giving it away by the bushel-full.
1,Whilst plowing their fields with their [domestic animal adjective] [draft animals], farmers uncovered a cache of ancient coins: [3d100] gold pieces have been equitably split within the community. Each is emblazoned with on one side with a forgotten queen and a mysterious tower on the other.
1,The [food veg] are growing exceptionally tall this year. Locals have discovered that clumps of medicinal herb *[magic plant]s* are thriving. This is one of the few non-magical cures for the horrid *[diseases]* and the villagers have made a tidy profit selling it off to visitors and travelling alchemists.
1,Visitors hear only laughter as [conveyances] groan and occasionally break under the weight of a record-breaking harvest of [food veg]. Since armies march on their stomach, [a war party]*[the war party]*'s agents have already indicated that their quartermasters intends to buy all of their surplus.
1,With [fruit]s ripening in abundance, the townsfolk have distilled a new tasty and potent spirit. This *[same fruit] [distilled beverage]* is quite delicious and already they are in trade-talks with the **dwarf** [dwarf with portrait], who plans to sell it in *[nearby village name]* ([dwarf stats]). “Will you travel with me?”

;animal event
1,Local [food veg] farmer *[human name]* couldn't believe their luck when every one of their [livestock] gave birth to healthy triplets this year.
1,Seen as an omen of good fortune, a [baby livestock] was born as white as the purest snow with a birthmark that eerily resembles [[good power] decoration]. Sacred to [same good power], the animal seems to be able to *[sacred ability]*.
1,The unruly geese tended to by the locals have recently been laying quite the surprise. Every few clutches contains a golden egg worth 25gp. As of yet, no one has held onto one long enough to see what hatches from them.
1,The old herder *[human name]* was distraught when one of their favorite [livestock] wandered off. When they finally tracked the beast down, it was found munching on a patch of valuable *[here magic plant]*.
1,The settlement was recently spared from a **[bandit|bugbear|goblin|orc]** raid due to a stampede of brave [livestock]. Herders have already begun breeding them for their fearlessness.

;holiday event
1,It is the festival of *Saint [old names for women]*, celebrated throughout the land for her miraculous ability to *[sacred ability]*. For the duration of the festival, all visitors are treated to a free meal of [rural meat prep] [food meat] [seasoning method] [with food seasonings] and as much [fruit] [distilled beverage] as they can drink.
1,From sunrise to sunset, the villagers here celebrate an ancient *Naming Festival*. Anyone whose name begins with the letter *[with random letter]* is treated royally and bedecked with flower wreaths, while anyone whose name begins with *[and random letter]* is playfully chastised and teased. It's also considered highly lucky for babies to be named by a visiting stranger on this day.
1,Today marks the birth of the hero: *[an old hero]* is rumored to hail from these parts. Friendly competitions (foot races, weight-lifting) may be hard to pass up, for the prize is a [a gem] encrusted [metal jewelry singular] (worth [3d6]00gp).

1,The tower is four stories high and has an entrance on the second level. A ladder leads up to it. Twenty large stones are stored on the roof. This should be enough to deter a peasant uprising.
1,The massive round tower is three stories high and topped with a wooden section that feels like a comfortable tree house in peace time. The walls are thick and the main doors are reinforced with iron bands.

;small keep
1,The keep consists of a square tower three stories high, a stable, a kennel, and a little courtyard enclosed by a strong wall. Inside the wall is a wooden walkway that allows guards to look over the wall and shoot anybody approaching.
1,The keep consists of a gatehouse protecting the small courtyard and a square tower four stories high.

;small temple dedicated to Set
1,[small temple]
1,The temple is nothing but a pit in the earth with a stone ceiling and the statue of a giant snake in the back. In front of the snake there are burning candles and wooden poles with strings attached and at the end of every string is an accusation: names of villagers and their misdeed, the punishment requested, and counter claims, and peace offerings. This is where the elders decide upon blood money to be paid and punishments to be exacted.
1,Between some rocks, a crack leads deeper into the earth and into a cave. There, a giant snake made of stone watches over all who pray to Set. A deep pit contains the polished bones of all who where killed in revenge for their misdeeds. There are always wooden accusation plates to be found naming bandits, thieves, murders, adulterers, and cowards who ran from a battle, deserting their village comrades. Will you take a plate and exact revenge in the name of Set?
1,An old stairway leads into the bowels of the earth where warm vapours make your head swim. Down here, the **spirit naga** *[naga name]* will guide your hand, should you need her words ([naga stats]; <span class="treasure">a *naga tongue* is worth 1000gp to an alchemist</span>[here store naga tongue as alchemist quest]). Spend an hour down here and any soul dedicated to Set will tell you of the past and the future, for all time goes in circles and the big snake eats itself.
1,Deep below, where the **spirit naga** *[naga name]* guards the passages to Myrkheim ([naga stats]; <span class="treasure">a *naga tongue* is worth 1000gp to an alchemist</span>[here store naga tongue as alchemist quest]), pools of Earth Blood corrupt both the living and the dead. If you spend an hour here, your death warrant is sealed: slowly, you will die, or turn into an ettin, or a goblin, or some other dreadful creature.
1,This is a snake pit, a breeding ground for [1d4 giant snakes] and [1d8 snakes], a place dangerous to every warm blooded creature. And yet, the terror of these snakes also keeps bandits at bay and no orc will set foot near this place, such is the power of Set. They say that those with the secret knowledge can use snake poison to poison their blades and they say that all who serve the temple have done just that.
1,The temple is a school for assassins. This is where you learn to sneak, to lie, to conceal, to poison, to stab, to strangle. Students learn the secrets of the garrote, of the hidden blade and of the crossbow. All of this is known and yet the farce continues: this is where the young ones learn discipline and strength, diligence and respect. It’s a way to put food on the table, and it’s a useful skill to have available if you’re trying to get ahead.

1,The temple is a simple mausoleum with a bone pit. The poor and foreign folks are brought here upon their death for it is said that in the hour of need the dead will rise and fight for us at the End of the World.
1,The temple is an underground network of crypts with dozens of bone chambers. The bones of the dead are used walls, floor, and ceiling. They say that the Bone Road of the underworld is similarly made of all the bones of the restless dead. There they await the End of the World. The bone chambers are there to remind us that everything must pass.
1,The temple is an underground labyrinth of tunnels with dozens of niches where warriors of old await the end of the world. Most of them are truly dead except for [1d8 mummies] ([mummy stats]). Down here in the cold darkness, somebody is always eager to whisper words of wisdom in exchange for gold and jewels intent on corrupting the world above. It is the hope for eternal life, of resurrection in this world, which brings people back again and again. [dead treasure]
1,Beneath the town, after descending into an old chamber via many stairs, is the temple: a black pit where the broken whispers of [1d8 wights] can be heard ([wight stats]). Down there are the tunnels of madness. Behind the pit is a statue of a naked man, fat and hairy, with the horns of a giant ram, served by satyrs and skeletons. This is the trickster demon lord, the only one capable of bringing back souls from the afterlife, or so they say. [dead treasure]
1,The temple is a burial mound with various secret crypts, each sealed and secured. Falling rocks, swinging blades, spiked pits, and hidden spears await the fools intent on disturbing the draugar, the restless dead, champions of old, warriors and sorcerers all, awakened and animated by the Earth Blood, waiting for their signal. When Fenrir devours the sun, the undead will smash their prison gates and it will be the end of all that is good.

1,The temple houses a traditional reed boat. This symbolizes the passage into the netherworld. Inscriptions on the wall describe sickness and death as the transition from the world of the living into the realm of Nergal. Behind the temple is the graveyard.
1,The temple is a school of exorcism. All the dead belong to Nergal and to animate the dead is theft. The temple specialises in the finding and killing of [undead].
1,The temple used to be a hospice but now most of the building is abandoned and sealed. Should the seal be broken, sickness and death awaits any trespassers. Poisonous molds. Deadly gases. Rotting diseases and blindness. The plague will return.
1,The temple is a big feasting hall and a meeting place for the sisters and brothers of the hunt. They hunt vampires wherever they go and thus they all carry magical blades. Beneath the hall are fortified sleeping quarters. This is where the elders lock themselves away when the moon is full for they are all **werewolves** ([werewolf stats]).
1,The temple is an asylum for the demented and the old. Everything is quiet. [3d6] **old people** sit there, staring at you, unblinking. Their caretaker is *[human name]* ([human stats]). Nergal wants the living to forget the dead and the process starts right here, right now.

;small temple dedicated to Pazuzu
1,[small temple]
1,The temple is built like the aerie of a giant vulture into a cliff. A narrow stair winds itself through the rock from the base up 100ft to this nest. There, a stone vulture watches the buildings below. A great many small dolls adorn the shelves at the back. These are all the lost children.
1,The temple is a four storied windowless square tower. Inside a set of ladders leads to the roof. There’s a lift with which to raise corpses to the roof. The roof itself is covered in broken bones. This is where the sky burial takes place. Meat boys and bone girls cut up the corpses and offer the remains of the dead to the vultures of Pazuzu.
1,The temple stands right next to hanging tree. There must be at least a hundred crows here. They say Pazuzu sees everything the crows see and thus the local priests are feared and everything that’s secret has to happen in the dark of night.
1,The temple stands on a rock needle about 100ft high with a rickety sequence of ladders leading up there. The four-winged statue of the crow demon Pazuzu is hard to see in all the smoke produced by smoldering fires in iron pots hanging in all four corners of the temple. The temple is looked after by [1d6 tengus].
1,The temple stands on a large rock about 20ft above the ground. Petitioners have to climb a rope hanging down over the edge. The temple also houses the **vulture demon** *[demon name]* ([vulture demon stats])
1,The temple is a a roofed platform made of wood built on top of a large rock about 20ft high. The platform has been blasted by fire many times. Many skulls are hanging from the roof. There is a statue of the four-winged god in each corner. Beneath it are the old runes spelling out the name Pazuzu. Whosoever utters his name three times will summon him. Pazuzu will be friendly and grant a wish, and take your soul (never to be resurrected again). To insult him will unleash an unholy blight dealing 20d6 damage to anybody within 10ft of the blasphemer; save vs. death for half damage.

1,Finally, the tunnels lead you to the underground [lair of the netherworld elves]<p>The [colour] gate from the [direction]ern courtyard is decorated with [Niflheim decoration]. It leads to the other side, to Niflheim.<p>[a sight of Niflheim]

;a sight of Niflheim
1,Overhead, grey clouds are blowing over the *[dark forest]* covered in snow. This is Niflheim, the land of eternal winter. [nearest objective in Niflheim]
1,It is dark, outside. You are surrounded by the giant trees of the *[dark forest]*. Overhead, there is a giant yellow moon. Wolves are howling in the distance. Soon, they’ll pick up your trail. [wolves or worse].<p>[nearest objective in Niflheim]
1,An acrid stench lies in the air. The outside world is covered in a warm, yellow fog that smells of metal, of burned flesh, of acid rain. A soft wind moves back and forth. This is the breadth of *Niđhöggr*, the gargantuan dragon sleeping amidst the roots of *Yggdrasil* somewhere down here in Niflheim, forever poisoning the world tree.<p>[nearest objective in Niflheim]
1,Icicles hang from giant trees and the cold is piercing. The stunted growth of the *[dark forest]* around you is covered in snow.<p>[nearest objective in Niflheim]

;nearest objective in Niflheim
1,In the [direction], you can see the *[dark mountain]*. On it lives the troll-king *[troll name]* with his [3d8] **trolls** ([troll stats]), [2d6] **harpies** [harpy stats], and his entourage of harpies, eternally feasting, served and defended by his [1d6x10] **human slaves** ([human stats]). [rich treasure]
1,In the [direction], you can see a fantastic jumble of walls, gates, moat, towers with gallows jutting out over the waters, swinging cages holding the dead and the living near the bridges, ravens on every rooftop. This festering castle is *Ejudnir*, Hel’s hall in Niflheim, guarded by [2d6x100] **trolls** ([troll stats]), watched over by [2d6x10] **harpies** ([harpy stats]), and filled with ten thousand despairing souls of cowards and the weak, moaning.<p>Truly, this is hell.

;small temple dedicated to Freya
1,[small temple]
1,The temple lies on a hill and boasts a great hall, a long house, where beer is always to be had. The walls are full of weapons and shields of famous patrons, and there are wood carvings of the Freya’s beautiful home in Asgard, the city of the gods, a realm all to itself.
1,The temple lies at the edge of the settlement, under some oak trees and with fields in the back. A few standing stones show Freya in her various guises over the course of the year. Sowing, growing, harvesting, and fighting. There are [3d6] [boars or wolves] living in the vicinity. The building itself is a longhouse with a grass roof.
1,The temple has a courtyard with the wooden statue of a wolf mother raising two human babies. The building is run by [2d6] **midwives** ([human stats]). Old *[woman]* is their spokeswoman. All the parents in this settlement know how much they owe these midwives, and they know it, too.
1,The temple belongs to the local [shield maidens], a society of armed women sworn to protect each other and their community. There are [3d6] **women** ([human stats]) led by *[woman]* living here and all are considered armed and dangerous by the locals.
1,The local priests have turned their attention on the sick and as their reputation grew, so did the number of petitioners waiting outside their hall every morning. There are currently [2d4] **priests** ([human stats]) under the guiding hand of *[woman]* tending the [3d10] sick and wounded.
1,This temple is run by the she-wolf **[woman]**. She is always in the company of her **winter wolf**, a beast as large as a pony, with red eyes and fearsome fangs.

;small temple dedicated to Odin
1,[small temple]
1,The temple houses an 8ft high wooden statue of Odin wielding his magic spear. An **old woman** named [woman with portrait] takes care of the temple. She knows the power of runes and will cast the stones for you, should want to locate a loved one or find a dragon.
1,The temple is actually a feast hall housing a small college of [3d6] **bards** led by [human with portrait].[store human as singing humanoid] During the day, they sing songs, practice balads, and compete in poetry. Their best known pieces are *[with story]* and *[and story]*. In the evening, the drink. All bards are expected to deliver a yearly donation for the upkeep of the college. Failure to do so results in being placed on a list. Should you need rescuing, they will contract a secret society to do that. Should you skip your obligation, they will contract a secret society to remedy that.
1,The temple is also a famous school for birds of prey. They are trained here and then sold to nobility in far away regions. The rich merchants making this trip often need guards and thus a mercenary house was established here. [mercenary house]
1,It was built generations ago atop a pool of Earth Blood by *Wise [human name]* in order to prevent its mutagenic power from corrupting the area. Many magic users and elves have come here over the years, drawn by the small eddies of magic energy still emanating from the sealed area: get one extra spell slot of your liking while you sleep nearby. *[inn]* was built next to the temple just for this. It’s run by the **inn keeper** [human with portrait].
1,The temple functions welcomes all wanderers and homeless people, housing people for up to week for a gold piece per person. This is the *[inn]* run by the **inn keeper** [human with portrait]. The common room has an entire altar built into it, including carved columns with eagles and ravens and showing Odin riding his eight legged horse over the rainbow bridge.

;small temple dedicated to Thor
1,[small temple]
1,The temple is in fact an altar built inside the village smith’s forge. This is where the strongest villagers meet every seven-night to discuss their grievances and resolve their issues. Money changes hands, children are promised into apprenticeship and journeymen are welcomed into the village. [local smith]
1,The temple is an altar at the foot of a big rock. The top has been hit by lightning countless times. Next to the altar is the wrestling field. Every festival involves wrestling and old *[human name]* is the most proficient **wrestler** here.
1,The temple stands in the backyard of *[human name]* the **chariot maker**. Inside it is a life sized statue of Thor riding a chariot drawn by two giant goats. The chariot maker is rich and has buried all his gold beneath the chariot.
1,The temple is one of the few places where they raise **giant goats**. There are currently [2d6] of these giant goats here ([giant goat stats]). The paintings beneath the roof show Thor riding his chariot pulled by his two famous goats. These giant goats are sold to [goat clients].

;small temple dedicated to Mitra
1,[small temple]
1,The temple stands on a little elevation, columns carrying a roof, and a stone altar in the middle, a smoking kettle containing the eternal flame that has been burning here ever since its foundation by *[an old hero]*. This sacred fire is the source for all the human fire in the valley.
1,The temple is dug into a hill, leading into a small chamber, big enough to barely fit twenty men. There’s a statue of a bull being stopped by Mitra herself. It is blackened by many years of blood and fire for the men swear to be like brothers of blood down here.
1,The temple looks like a tower, except that it has a big window from the bottom to the roof. On the inside, there are no extra floors. The room is simply 50ft high. The strip of light from the window falls on one of three oath brother statues in here, each raising their right hand, each pointing three fingers towards the sky. This is the bond of loyalty that makes us strong.
1,The temple has a door fit for a giant, but inside there is simply a strip of wooden flooring for petitioners to kneel and a big statue of Mitra standing blindfolded in a sea of fire, holding the balance of justice in one hand and the sword of judgement in the other.
1,A long set of winding stairs leads deep underground to a fiery pit. The fumes are intoxicating and the dreamy babbling of a woman’s voice can be heard but her words make no sense to you. She is one of the eternal servants, gifted to the temple by her parents and bound to pass through the lake of fire into Muspelheim, the realm of Mitra, whence nobody has ever returned. This is of course true: the lake of fire is a one-way gate to [a location in Muspelheim]. Most of these women eventually master the arcane arts of pyromancy.
1,Deep within the bowels of the earth, a pool of Earth Blood is being kept at bay by circles of banishment and stasis and thus evil **gorgon** and its poison remains imprisoned while these seals last ([gorgon stats]). The temple guards the entry to this underworld and the [2d6] **priests** and *[human name]*, the current head of the temple, inspect and improve their defences every year on the night of the winter solstice. The common folks just see the statues of the three oath brother statues here and come here to renew their bond with Mitra. They call themselves the *Oath Keepers* for this is what they do: they make their bargains here.
