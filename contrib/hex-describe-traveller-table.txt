;on names
1,<p>**Names:** When Chinese or Japanese names are being used, the order is *surname* then *given name*; other names use the order *given name* then *surname*; some people have no surname.

;on stats
1,<p>**Stats:** Characteristics are given for a 2d6 system with values ranging from 2 to 12, using A, B, and C for 10, 11, and 12. For a person, the *<dfn id="UPP">Universal Personality Profile</dfn>* (<abbr title="Universal Personality Profile">UPP</abbr>) consists of strength, dexterity, endurance, intelligence, education, and social standing. For a system, the *<dfn id="uwp">Universal World Profile</dfn>* (<abbr title="Universal World Profile">UWP</abbr>) consists of starport (A-E, X), size, atmosphere, water, population, government, law, a dash, and tech level.

;on equipment
1,<p>**Equipment:** It is assumed that every non-player character in this document comes equipped with at least one weapon they are skilled in. Remember that a ship’s locker contains the basics for survival on an alien word, plus equipment to defend against boarding: protective clothing, vacc suits, tools, portable shelters, but also weapons such as shotguns, carbines, pistols, and ammunition.

1,<p>The population is ruled by a self-perpetuating oligarchy: the *[human surname]* family is the oldest founding family of the settlement and managed to stay afloat all these years.
1,<p>All the important positions in the system are filled by members of the *[human surname]* family. They are all descendants of the *[company name]* founder, the *[human name]*. They are called “the princes & princesses” and there is no touching them.
1,<p>The ruling caste claims an genetic predisposition for rule. It is all propaganda, of course, and yet these “Sons and Daughter of [same name]” keep the reins of power and none dare oppose them.
1,<p>A hereditary senate rules the system with [an iron fist|a lot of ceremony|many, extensive rituals] and it is impossible for others to ever enter these ranks. Apparently a system retained from the old days, a second wave of settlement making sure they got an unfair share of the economic output.
1,<p>The system is ruled by two parliaments: the [popular|people’s|common|lower] parliament is open to all and has practically no power, where as the [senate|house of lords|inner circle|upper parliament|council of elders|council of elders] wields actual power and its membership is inherited from [father to eldest son|mother to eldest daughter].

1,<p>While unsettled, there is an elected representative from the *[nearby big port]* authorities, here: *[human name]*.

;government-4
1,<p>The system is governed by a representative democracy. The system favours just two parties, and these two parties split the populace into two equal halves that contest bitterly for supremacy. The two parties are the *[with party]* and the *[and party]*, and where as they claim large and important differences, the actual differences are small and confined to a few key issues. The *[same party]* are currently in power, led by *[human name]*.
1,<p>The system is governed by a representative democracy. The system favours just many small parties and unstable governments. The constitution cannot be changed without a civil war, but without the change there is no stability. Currently, a minority government under the *[party]* led by *[human name]* governs. Everyday, the press claims the government is about to fall. And yet, they’re holding on.
1,<p>The system is governed by a representative democracy. The system favours a few big parties and stable governments. The *[with party]* have been in power for [1d10+9] years and have been led by *[human name]* all this time. The opposition is fragmented and weak. Currently the *[and party]* led by *[human name]* are trying to challenge the status quo. [However, they don’t stand a chance unless they make drastic changes|They are gaining ground and are set to win the upcoming elections].
1,<p>The system is governed by a representative democracy. The system favours a handful of parties with no clear winners and stable governments. Executive power lies in a committee with representatives of all the powers. The current ceremonial head of the government is *[human name]*.

1,<p>While unsettled, there is a system operator from *[nearby big port]* here, *[human name]*. They maintain the network in this system.

;government-5
1,<p>The entire system has been divvied up between a handful of tech giants that provide civil full services for their customers. Entire families and buildings “belong” to their *[with company name]*, *[and company name]*, or *[and company name]*. Their homes, their schools, their transportation, it all belongs to one of these companies. It’s a feudal technocracy.
1,<p>The life support systems and civil infrastructure in this system belong to a different age with a higher tech level, and now they’re starting to fail. They’re barely kept working by so called “[tech|life|building|pipe] [priests|wizards|mages|sorcerers]”, the ancient [secrets|knowledge] carefully passed [from father to son|from mother to daughter|from parent to child]. It’s a feudal technocracy.
1,<p>Society has splintered into various group, each trying to live according to slightly different rules. In order to allow for this, an elaborate system of [labels|rituals] and [traditions|organisations] has been set up such that each person can be ruled according to their allegiance. The entire system is controlled by a caste of [programmers|administrators|tech wizards|government service providers]. It all sounds very benevolent until you find that it’s hard to switch your allegiance – and then it dawns on you that you’re living in a feudal technocracy.

;government-6
1,<p>This is a colony of the *[nearby big port]*. The local [administration|puppet government] is led by the *[human name]*. The locals are squeezed for all they’re worth and suffer. The [rebellion|resistance] is gaining power, led by the charismatic *[human name]*. There is going to be violence, soon. 
1,<p>This is a colony of the *[nearby big port]*. The local [administration|puppet government] is led by the *[human name]*. The parent system has been subsidising all the recent developments, but money is starting to run out. They are no longer willing to fund the colony and *[same human name]* is struggling to prepare the locals for independence. Should the transition fail, all hell is going to break loose.
1,<p>In a recent conflict with *[nearby big port]*, the entire local government was replaced by a new administration more [amenable|agreeable] to the victors. The leader of the new administration is *[human name]*, [acquiescent|submissive] and quick to say that now is the time to [forgive and forget|make amends], not to seek revenge for fear of reprisals.
1,<p>When terrorists on *[nearby big port]* turned out to be from *[same name]*, it didn’t take long before the navy showed up, overthrew the old order on [same name], and installed a puppet government, currently led by *[human name]*. Curfews, patrols, interrogations, allegations of torture, and occasional revelations thereof provide fertile grounds for more shootings, more bombs, more assassinations. These are bad times.

;government-7
1,<p>The system has fallen apart into multiple polities: each urban centre claiming sovereignty, involved in border disputes, internal squabbles, unable to deal with the imperial order in the subsector. The starport falls within the sphere of influence of *[space name]*. It’s a mess.
1,<p>The system was settled in different places at different times. The initial phase was rough and there never developed any cohesion. Now the system is balkanized, with the local governments appealing each to their rich past, unwilling to give up any privileges. The starport is controlled by the *[space name]*. It’s tricky.
1,<p>After the recent upheavals and the ensuing civil war, the system has splintered into different groups, each led by a warlord. [warlord situation] The starport is controlled by warlord *[human name]*.
1,<p>The system is balkanized but stable. Many smaller states have fought cruel wars to create the illusion of a homogeneous local population. With this goal attained and stabilised using propaganda and the self-interests of the elite, things won’t be changing any time soon. This also makes the system easy prey for imperial actors, obviously. The starport is built in the *[space name]* region.

;warlord situation
1,There’s peace right now, and negotiations are ongoing.
1,The cease fire has held for many years, now.
1,There’s [a cease fire in place|peace] right now, but recent reports by the scout service indicate a buildup of forces.
1,There’s peace right now but all the warlords are hiring military specialists so the outlook is dim.

;government-8
1,<p>The civil service bureaucracy on [same name] has served the population well: through all the ups and downs of recent decades, the unchanging civil service exams make sure that the ranks of government are filled with competent experts. People study long and hard when they’re young, which makes for good candidates, but it also takes its toll: drop outs end up with lousy jobs. Depression and suicides are common. The [worst of the lot|most prestigious institution] is the *[civil service institution]*.
1,<p>The state maintains elite civil service institutes to train its next generation of civil servants. This has served the population well: through all the ups and downs of recent decades, the unchanging civil service exams make sure that the ranks of government are filled with competent experts. People study long and hard when they’re young, which makes for good candidates, but it also takes its toll: drop outs end up with lousy jobs; depression and suicides are common. The [worst of the lot|most prestigious institution] is the *[civil service institution]*.
1,<p>Every young citizen on [same name] spends two years in the civil service. On the one hand, this means that you find trainees on all levels of government. On the other hand, this means citizens all know what it’s like to work inside the government. The best administrators stay and make their careers in government. There is a lot of grumbling about those two years, but there is also a lot of pride. The [most prestigious institution|the harshest one ] is the *[civil service institution]*.
1,<p>The influence of the empire comes and goes. What keeps the government running is the civil service bureaucracy. Everything of strategic importance is run by the state: the postal services, transportation networks, markets, construction, the energy sector. Things are slow to change because all important changes haven through the political system. On the other hand, people feel that resources are allocated fairly. The [most prestigious one is|current members of government all met at] the *[civil service institution]*.

1,<p>The impersonal bureaucracy of [same name] is a meat grinder. More than two dozen ministries run the state; more than three dozen secret services monitor communications and commerce. The rules contradict each other, the laws are different on all three levels of the state; precedents are important but access to the law is restricted. If you’re investigated by the state, you’ll always be in infraction of some rule or another. Everything is labyrinthine and nepotism is the only way to assure things actually work, at least occasionally. The [worst of them all is the|breeding ground for all this corruption is the all-mighty] *[civil service institution]*.
1,<p>The codes and laws governing [same name] have remained unchanged for centuries. New directives are piled on old ones, executive orders partially overturn some rules but not other. The court system is huge and lawyers are the most important human resources for everybody. Taxation is fairly low but court fees are unavoidable and significant.
1,<p>Professional politicians are elected into government and hardly ever leave. This encourages them to promise whatever is necessary at the beginning but soon “The Game” begins, jockeying for positions, forming and betraying alliances, backstabbing. Should some clueless soul such as *[human name]* most recently decide to stand for office with the stated intent of “cleaning up” they’ll soon find themselves inundated in accusations of molestation, bribery, and incompetence; and if that doesn’t help, organised crime is going to break into their homes, kidnap their family members, kill their pets.
1,<p>The central government ordains what is to be done, the local branches of government follow orders or are replaced. The machinations in the centre of power are inscrutable and it doesn’t matter who you vote for, the result is always the same. And yet, it somehow works. Occasionally there are strikes, and the burning of trash and disruption of commerce, but then everything calms down again and business as usual resumes. The local governor responsible for the starport is *[human name]*. Follow orders is their core competency.

;government-A
5,<p>This system is ruled by *[human name]*, a charismatic dictator. They got to power on a platform of [order|unity|fiscal discipline] and [development|progress|prosperity], and they promised to [fight corruption|break up the monopolies|enact land reform|tax the rich|find work for the young|introduce universal basic income|reform the system|regain former military glory]. [popular support]
1,<p>This system is ruled by *[human name]*, a charismatic dictator. They deposed the old government after they had failed to put down a rebellion and got dragged into a civil war. *[same human name]* cleaned up the mess, put down the rebellion, initiated the necessary reforms, and finally deposed the government as well. [popular support]
1,<p>The twenty year plans elaborated by the colleges of statecraft and economy are adhered to in exacting ways, for complex networks of informants, controllers and consultants produce a steady churn of promotions and demotions based on goal achievement with respect to “The Plan”. It is more important to follow the plan than to solve actual problems for the locals. The only way this is made bearable is a complex network of shadow markets and informal ties.
1,<p>Old computer networks control production and distribution; the operators and programmers are servants of the system and nobody really understands the byzantine routes the logistic optimiser produces. In the end, it all works out somehow and since everybody is afraid of a breakdown, all resources are invested into maintenance and extension of the existing system, even though nobody really understands it.

;popular support
1,They are riding a wave of popular support, for now.
1,The underlying causes are far from resolved, however.

;government-B
1,<p>When *[human name]* passed away, [their protege|the vice chancellor|the vice president|the senate head] *[human name]* took over and tried to [uphold the old order|live up to their predecessor’s legacy|institute smaller reforms], but they lack charisma and slowly popular support has been eroding.
1,<p>When *[human name as old boss]* fell ill, [their old friend|their right hand|the head of the secret service|general] *[human name]* took over daily affairs. They still consult with their predecessor, and they both emphasise how well they work together, but there’s no denying that the old leader is falling apart. It’s still too early for big changes, and so tensions are rising as people await the inevitable death of *[same old boss]*.
1,<p>Another five year plan, but this time *[human name]* was not confirmed as party leader. Instead, *[human name]* has taken the reigns of power. Contrary to their predecessor, however, they lack charisma and made one blunder after another in their public affairs. The locals are not happy.
1,<p>Another five year plan, but this time *[human name as old boss]* was not confirmed as party leader. Instead, *[human name]* was elected. Soon enough, *[same old boss]* was found dead, an undiagnosed heart conditions according to the party papers, murder, according to the rumour mill.

;government-C
1,<p>This is a charismatic oligarchy: the *[human surname]* clan governs the system fairly and for the benefit of all. The spectre of drawbacks of nepotism are currently small because the rapid economic expansion of recent years has given everybody hope that they too might one day rise and marry into “the clan”.
1,<p>[1d4]0 years ago, the *[party]* won the last free elections and have managed to stay in power ever since, first by changing the election laws, then by changing the constitution. And yet, the system works. There is little squabbling and decisions are made swiftly and decisively, corruption is held down and press is free. The current “[elder spokesperson|elder statesperson|supreme leader|first amongst equals|party speaker|party leader|chancellor for life]” is *[human name]*.
1,<p>The church rules the system with benevolence and foresight. The institution has survived a thousand years and shows no sign of failing. Every child spends a year in a monastery after leaving their home, and the youngest child in every family is expected to join the church for life. Thus, everybody is connected to the church, and everybody benefits. The ceremonial head of the church is *[human name]*.
1,<p>[1d4]0 years ago, [bureaucrat|supreme accountant|supreme consultant] *[human name]* was appointed by the leaders of a military coup against the old government to reorganize the state. As *[same human name]* wasn’t part of the military it comes as no surprise that the head of state plays only a ceremonial role. The power lies in the hands of military councils. It’s been working fine until now and so there’s not a lot of grumbling. The road to advancement is obvious to all: join the army, advance in ranks, and you too can be part of the military councils.

;government-D
1,<p>The system has fallen into a religious dictatorship. A council of elders supports *[human name]*, a religious leader who mediates between this world and the next. Dissent is persecuted relentlessly. Morals are heavily regulated. Public life and private life offer a stark contrast.
1,<p>A religious sect as taken over, the *[religious sect]* under the leadership of *[human name]*. The previous dictatorship was overthrown, political prisoners were released, and the economy was reformed. The population is jubilant but already the new government is full of sycophants, members of the old guard, just as corrupt as before.
1,<p>A while ago, a religious dictatorship was installed by *[human name]*, the founder of the *[religious sect]*. The structures have since ossified, a theocracy has been established and all dissent is suppressed. Reform seems impossible, as hopeful candidates have been rendered [toothless|powerless] by the establishment. Currently, the [reformer|hardliner|weak] *[human name]* is head of the civil government and everybody knows: nothing will change.
1,<p>The original settlement was made by refugees belonging to the *[religious sect]*, wanting peace and solitude. Over generations, the religious institutions provided schooling, administration, and handled the economy. It would seem impossible to wrestle control from them, now. The head of the church is *[human name]*
